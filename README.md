# Triangle Area Calculator
A program that computes the area of an aribitrary triangle.

## Setup
1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you don't already have it.

2. Open terminal and run the git clone command:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cramaechi/triangle-area-calculator.git
   ```
    or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/cramaechi/triangle-area-calculator/archive/master.zip).

3. Go to the project folder:

   ```
   $ cd triangle-area-calculator
   ```

4. Compile:

   ```
   $ make
   ```
   
## Usage
Run:

```
$ ./triangle_area_calculator
```

Sample Output:
```
Enter three sides of an arbitrary triangle: 1 2 4                                                                     
The area of the triange could not be computed.
